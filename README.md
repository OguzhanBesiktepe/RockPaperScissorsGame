# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game The Odin Project

This is a simple implementation of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game using JavaScript. The game allows a player to compete against the computer over 5 rounds, with the results of each round being displayed in the console. After all rounds are completed, the game announces the overall winner.

How to Play

Run the game in the browser console.

You will be prompted to enter your choice: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.

The computer will randomly select its choice.

The game will announce the result of each round and keep score.

After 5 rounds, the final winner will be declared.
